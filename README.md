# A Variation of the Renard Series

The Renard Series is a system of preferred numbers which divides an interval
from 1 to 10 into an approximately geometric sequence. We propose a variation
of the Renard 10 Series (R10 Series), altering the 6th and 9th element:

- 1.00 (1st element)
- 1.25 (2nd element)
- 1.60 (3rd element)
- 2.00 (4th element)
- 2.50 (5th element)
- 3.20 (6th element, the standardized R10 Series has 3.15 here)
- 4.00 (7th element)
- 5.00 (8th element)
- 6.40 (9th element, the standardized R10 Series has 6.30 here)
- 8.00 (10th element)
- 10.0 (1st element in next decade)
- 12.5 (2nd element in next decade)
- 16.0 (3rd element in next decade)
- and so on...

By changing the 6th and 9th entries, we ensure that:

- Every element is either 1.25 or 1.28 times the previous element. The standard
  series has ratios of 1.23, 1.25, 1.28 and ≈1.30 between adjacent elements.
  - A consequence of this is that every element are is either 1.6000 or
    1.5625 (which is 1.25²) times the element two steps before it.
- Most elements are exactly twice the element 3 steps before them.
  - The exception is the second element, 1.25 (or 12.5, &c) -- the element 3
    steps before it is 0.64 (or 6.4, &c.).
  - In the standardized R10 Series, not only the 2nd element, but also
    the 6th element, is not twice the element 3 steps before it.

This variation leads to a variation of the standardized Renard 5 Series
(R5 Series):

- 1.00 (R5: 1st element)
- 1.60 (R5: 2nd element)
- 2.50 (R5: 3rd element)
- 4.00 (R5: 4th element)
- 6.40 (R5: 5th element, the standardized R5 Series has 6.30 here)
- 10.0
- and so on...

What we might call the "R3 Series", is also called the 1-2-5 Series, where each
step is a very coarse approximation of the cube root of 10:

- 1.00 (R3: 1st element)
- 2.00 (R3: 2nd element)
- 5.00 (R3: 3rd element)
- 10.0
- and so on...

## Miscellaneous Series

Perhaps a useful intermediate between R3 and R5 is the following selection of
numbers for an "R4 Series":

- 1.00 (1st element)
- 1.60 (2nd element)
- 3.20 (3rd element)
- 5.00 (4th element)
- 10.0
- and so on...

Another potentially useful R4 Series:

- 1.00 (1st element)
- 2.50 (2nd element)
- 5.00 (3rd element)
- 8.00 (4th element)
- 10.0
- and so on...

In this series, each factor gets smaller (2.50×, 2.00×, 1.60×, 1.25×).
